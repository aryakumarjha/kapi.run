- **Self Hosting**: Follow the setup instructions below to host your own instance

## What Problem Does It Solve?

In many offices, one person typically takes responsibility for collecting and placing group food/beverage orders. This process usually involves:

1. Manually collecting orders from colleagues
2. Keeping track of individual customizations
3. Managing order cutoff times
4. Consolidating everything into a single order

kapi.run streamlines this process by:

1. Allowing the order coordinator to create a shareable ordering session
2. Setting clear cutoff times for order submissions
3. Enabling team members to add their own items with customizations
4. Providing a consolidated view of all orders for easy checkout

## Key Features

- 🔗 Shareable session links for easy collaboration
- ⏰ Customizable order cutoff times
- 🛒 Real-time cart updates
- 🔄 Item customization support
- 👥 Multiple participants per session
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface
- 🌙 Dark/Light mode support

## How It Works

1. **Session Creation**

   - Order coordinator selects a restaurant
   - Sets a cutoff time for orders
   - Gets a shareable link

2. **Order Collection**

   - Team members open the shared link
   - Add their items with customizations
   - Submit their selections

3. **Order Placement**
   - Coordinator reviews the consolidated cart
   - Ensures all items are correct
   - Places the final order through the actual delivery platform
